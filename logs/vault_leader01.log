WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://192.168.2.10:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: BzfU/4AHLw41+64FzoqDj23l0RMh6pBcQdkWd5h+Rjc=
Root Token: dc5a5c76-86a5-1705-2e1c-8fe836b4ec61

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
